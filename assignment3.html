Hello! My name is Rowan, and you're viewing my Principles of Programming assignment!<br>

<H1>The Borough of Montoursville</H1> is a very nice place to grow up in. 
Boring, uneventful, old, and small are all words I would use to describe the town. With not much to do, life isn't too crazy. 
As a whole, though, Montoursville is a farming, back-country community. Many of my teachers 
throughout grade school actually grew up in Montoursville, went to community college, and then began their
careers at the schools they graduated from. I generally loved my teachers, but I will not be doing what they did.<br> 

<H2>Staying put has never been my way of life.</H2> Even now, being at Juniata for 4 years to complete my degrees is seemingly dragging on forever.
I want to explore and find the perfect place for me. This place would be green and mountainous and have running water.
Although, I wouldn't mind going out to the desert either.<br> 

<H3>As a believer in fate I guess I'll just have to see where I end up!</H3><br>
